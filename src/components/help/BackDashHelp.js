                                <li>Clicking the keys gets the target of the events text content and pushes it to an array.</li>
                                <li>Both the login and password push additional content to allow for firebase authorization, such as adding @fireit.ca to create a fake email address.</li>

                                <li><h3>Data Display:</h3></li>
                                <li>The Menu Entry Setup navigation bars change string states to determine what to display, the states are also prop drilled through the components to the form, where they are used to determine the collection reference to search in firestore, first to populate the items list then specify which document to search for when an item is clicked.</li>
                                <li>In the begining this was done with true/false states, but as I started to add more data categories I eventually changed them to strings as the list of states was not very DRY. </li>
                                <li>When an item is selected from the list its' data is used to populate placeholders for any values that exist.</li>
                                <li>I did want these place holders to be able to have the selections or radio buttons pre chosen from the data like the placeholders, but it was causing issues with updates to the item, and is something I plan to review later. For now I opted to give them labels to display the current data.</li>
                                <li>I originally found a solution to reset the forum inputs by query selecting them all and then setting them to default states, such as checked = false, I later learned to just query the form itself and .reset()</li>
                                <li><h3>Item Manipulation:</h3></li>
                                <li>Clicking any item gets the e.target.id which is generated from firestores auto id, rather than being setDoc like in other areas of this app, menu items are created with addDoc.</li>
                                <li>Adding items collects values selected by the user, or useRefs for text. A name must exist to create an item, and for now if no screen name is given the document will upload with the screen name the same as the item name.</li>
                                <li>The update doc checks for any changes on the individual form values so that only the updated one is changed in firestore.</li>
                                <li>Cloning items was used in the Squirrel UI so I opted to recreate it as well as adding many new items myself was going to be tedious. Selecting to clone the item copies all the information for the item and creates a new one with -CLONE added to the name, the user can then update. This would simplify adding for example several burgers which would be fundamentally the same but have a different name.</li>
                                <li>As stated in the user guide, several of these data points for items would be for use beyond the project's MVP.</li>

                                <li>As it was made after the Menu Entry Setup section, much of the Employee Data form's logic is replicated from there.</li>
                                <li>Employees are added with setDocs to allow for the document id to match the employee number.</li>
                                <li>A useEffect watches if changes in employee number or userID match one that is already in use to prevent duplicates. I later updated this to also allow for blank userIDs.</li>
                                <li>I opted to update the form to block deletions on users who have been activated through Firebase for now. The previously activated combo would still be capable of logging in to the app, which would crash due to no longer finding matching employee data credentials.</li>
                                <li>From my understanding Firebase admin sdk would be required to delete authorized users through the app and not the firebase console, so that may be a stretch goal, otherwise not finding matching employee data for the employeeContext could cause an alert and log out.</li>
                                <li>Employee Firebase activation starts with a useEffect watching the email for the selected employee and running fetchSignInMethodsForEmail comparing the length for greater than zero.This sets the state to prevent activated employees from being deleted. The activation component required props to be destructured to limit the conditions array.</li>
                                <li>Because creating Firebase users also logs you in, to prevent errors or user confusion they are logged out upon 'activation'. This has a side benefit of bringing the user directly to the log in to use the created employee.</li>
