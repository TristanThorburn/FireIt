    <ul>
        <li>I added some unnecessary components thinking I needed to have two versions of the keypad, one for username and one for user pin but I was able to get simple logic pushing arrays for the codes based on length.</li>
        <li>Had to google the exact syntax to merge the numbers in the array and remove commas</li>
        <li>.join() and a regex for .replace(/,/g, '')</li>
        <li>Need some sort of reset mechanic for they keypad</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Set up reset and submit logics, I'm not happy but there was issues with setState ruining the array push when used to toggle disabled</li>
        <li>Main branch needed: "start": "set \"BROWSER=none\" && start firefox localhost:3000 && react-scripts start",</li>
        <li>Drama pushing to setState array, just refactored back to pushing to a basic array like yesterday</li>
        <li>How am I gonna trick firebase without an email / FIREBASE WANTS 6 CHAR PASSWORDS UGH! Solution:
            ( Pushing additional info to array required to hit credential reqs )
            â€”---refactor to not require the submit?
            </li>
        <li>Basic table map set up as ugly as the original</li>
        <li>Next hurdle, logic to transfer between Siblings Menu / Table Tabs, maybe another use context?</li>
        <li>Possibly put in some info to inform you the userID is okay, or that clear reset the terminal</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Chris found the log in difficult, I had mis-remembered the way it works and I need to make it more apparent to a user what is going on if the purpose of this app is to explain to people not from restaurants</li>
        <li>My new goal is to set up a pseudo back end that has menu item data that is pulled to the menu screen</li>
        <li>Tables can be set and re-set on the firebase data to mimic changing tabs</li>
        <li>Payment tab, some sort of set method clearing the check and faking a payments history</li>
        <li>Firebase Admin SDK is very confusing and theres no youtube videos after 2019</li>
    </ul>
