=>Created to explore the logic of some of the Point of Sale systems I used while previously working in the restuarant industry.

=>See INFO buttons dispersed throughout the components of this project, to detail what the project can currently do, and some insights to the code & strategies to accomplish this.

=>My MVP goal was to be able to replicate the flow of a 'server' greeting tables and punching in an order, splitting the check, and 'taking payments' in the front dash / server view. In addition, in a back dash / manager or admin view, the ability to change the layout of the tables floor plan, create/update/delete menu items to be ordered, and an employee database of servers who can use the server view.

This app is designed to mimic desktop touch screen terminals used in restaurants/bars. There is some styling for >= tablet size, though most is 1920x1080, I do not currently forsee mobile styling as it would currently involve too much scrolling.

Primarily inspired by my 4 years working exclusively with Squirrel (https://www.squirrelsystems.com/)
