Created to explore the logic of some of the Point of Sale systems I used while working in a prior carrer, and also to demonstrate how working with them lead me to pursue an industry change. For more information see info and help buttons in the app.

This app is designed to mimic desktop touch screen terminals used in restaurants/bars. There will be future tablet styling to come, however this app will not have mobile styling.

Primarily inspired by my 3 years working exclusively with Squirrel (https://www.squirrelsystems.com/)
